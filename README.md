# odin-recipes
This is my first project with The Odin Project.
In this project I am building recipe pages and a homepage.
In this I have learned how to write a boilerplate, link pages back to a hompeage and vice-versa, add images and learned the basics of HTML.
In my project I also have a small bit of styling just because I wanted to incorporate that which I learned simultaneously while learning the Odin Project.
This is my first project of more to come and I am excited to learn more.

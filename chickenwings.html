    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>
      Growing up in New Orleans I got used to a little bit of spice. As a child,
      I moved around a lot and I could not find a lot of foods that pleased my
      palette. <br> As a result, I use to add spice to all types of food and one
      result is my favorite way to make chicken wings. With a little spice, and
      a lot of flavor my famous wings were born.</br> I hope you enjoy these wings as
      much as I do. A little reminder from home is always a good thing.
    </p>
